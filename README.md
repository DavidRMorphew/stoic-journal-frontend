The Stoics Journal UI
Storing Reflections and Making Connections
This user interface is designed to present random quotations from ancient Stoic authors at random for the user to reflect upon and write responses to in their own personal journal.

Plans
I also hope to integrate a dictation feature / voice recording feature for those who might use this app on a phone, and for those who would rather speak their thoughts rather than type them.
